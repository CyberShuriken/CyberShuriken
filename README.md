## 📖 About Me

I'm currently pursuing my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering (2nd year), with a strong passion for cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and system design. Professionally, I work as a **System Analyst** at **SoundCasting Solution LTD BD**, where I apply my knowledge to analyze, improve, and secure enterprise systems.

My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity, hands-on experimentation, and a commitment to continuous learning. Whether it’s working on automation tools, hunting bugs, or diving into CTFs, I’m always looking to sharpen my skills.
